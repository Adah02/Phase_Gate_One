			People with the INTP personality type (Logicians) pride themselves on their unique perspective and vigorous intellect. 
			They can’t help but puzzle over the mysteries of the universe – which may explain why some of the most influential 
			philosophers and scientists of all time have been INTPs. People with this personality type tend to prefer solitude, as

			Quick-witted and audacious, people with the ENTP personality type (Debaters) aren’t afraid to disagree with the status

			more than a bit of verbal sparring – and if the conversation veers into controversial terrain, so much the better.
			It would be a mistake, though, to think of ENTPs as disagreeable or mean-spirited. Instead, people with this personality

			People with the ISFP personality type (Adventurers) are true artists – although not necessarily in the conventional

			time, they act in ways that vividly reflect who they are as unique individuals. With their exploratory spirit and their 
			ability to find joy in everyday life, ISFPs can be among the most interesting people you’ll ever meet.
			Driven by their sense of fairness and their open-mindedness, people with this personality type move through life 
			with an infectiously encouraging attitude. They love motivating those close to them to follow their passions and usually

			People with the ISTP personality type (Virtuosos) love to explore with their hands and their eyes, touching and examining 
			the world around them with an impressive diligence, a casual curiosity, and a healthy dose of skepticism. They are natural 
			makers, moving from project to project, building the useful and the superfluous for the fun of it and learning from their 
			environment as they go. They find no greater joy than in getting their hands dirty pulling things apart and putting them back 
			together, leaving them just a little bit better than they were before.
			ISTPs prefer to approach problems directly, seeking straightforward solutions over convoluted troubleshooting methods.

			In fact, they excel at keeping their attention rooted in their present – so much so that they rarely find themselves fixated on 
			the time throughout the day.
			Theory, abstract concepts, and plodding discussions about global issues and their implications don’t keep ESTP personalities 
			interested for long. They keep their conversations energetic, with a good dose of intelligence, but they like to talk about what 
			is – or better yet, to just go out and do it. They often leap before they look, fixing their mistakes as they go rather than sitting

			If anyone is to be found spontaneously breaking into song and dance, it is people with the ESFP personality type (Entertainers).

			with their time and energy when it comes to encouraging others, and no other type does it with such irresistible style.
			ESFP personalities are inclined toward putting on a show for others and generally appear to be very comfortable in the spotlight. 
			However, it is not their love for being the center of attention that drives this sense of confidence but their knack for sensing what’s 
			appropriate in certain situations. They have an uncanny ability to mirror the behaviors of those around them.
			ESFPs truly enjoy the simplest things, and there’s no greater joy for them than just having fun with a good group of friends. People

			Idealistic and principled, people with the INFJ personality type (Advocates) aren’t content to coast through life – they want to stand up 
			and make a difference. For these compassionate personalities, success doesn’t come from money or status but from seeking fulfillment, 
			helping others, and being a force for good in the world.
			While they have lofty goals and ambitions, INFJs shouldn’t be mistaken for idle dreamers. People with this personality type care about 
			integrity, and they’re rarely satisfied until they’ve done what they know to be right. Conscientious to the core, they move through life 
			with a clear sense of their values, and they aim to never lose sight of what truly matters – not according to other people or society at 
			large but according to their own wisdom and intuition.
			Perhaps because their personality type is so uncommon, INFJs tend to carry around a sense – whether conscious or not – of being 
			different from most people. With their rich inner lives and their deep, abiding desire to find their life purpose, they don’t always fit in

			 memorabilia that brighten their days and fill their heart with joy.
			Idealistic and empathetic, people with the INFP personality type long for deep, soulful relationships, and they feel called to help 
			others. Due to the fast-paced and competitive nature of our society, they may sometimes feel lonely or invisible, adrift in a world

			including their relationships. Few things bring people with the ENFJ personality type a deeper sense of joy and fulfillment

			ENFJs tend to be vocal about their values, including authenticity and altruism. When something strikes them as unjust or 
			wrong, they speak up. But they rarely come across as brash or pushy, as their sensitivity and insight guide them to speak in 
			ways that resonate with others.
			ENFJ personalities have not only an uncanny ability to pick up on people’s underlying motivations and beliefs but also a knack 
			for understanding how others are feeling just by looking at them. At times, they may not even understand how they come to

			ENFP personalities carry an interesting blend of carefree sociability, sparkling imagination, and deep, contemplative

			and the complex dynamics of human relationships. And they are truly devoted to nurturing their relationships with and 
			their understanding of the world at large.
			In their unique way, ENFPs’ introspective nature is driven by their imagination, wonder, and belief in things that cannot

			that ISTJ personalities also tend to have a deep respect for structure and tradition. They are often drawn to organizations,

			While ISTJs may not be particularly flashy or attention seeking, they do more than their share to keep society on a sturdy, stable
